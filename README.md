Time Series Analysis and Hypothesis Testing for Unit Generation in USA

Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for conducting time series analysis and hypothesis testing on unit generation data for the USA from January 1, 1990, to June 1, 2023. The analysis includes hypothesis testing using the t-test to compare two groups and prediction using ARIMA and SARIMA models.

Hypothesis Testing
Null Hypothesis (H0)
There is no significant difference in the mean 'Unit Generated' between two groups.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1)
There is a significant difference in the mean 'Unit Generated' between the groups.

Time Series Prediction
The prediction of unit generation is done using ARIMA and SARIMA models. These models forecast future unit generation based on historical data.

File Structure
Final_Total_Dataframe_Stats: Contains the dataset for unit generation.
